# Week 12 - Digital Prototype Playtesting
Today's practical is your chance to playtest your game in its digital form, just as last week you did your playtesting of your physical game.

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* playingcards.io
* Whatever tools you have for playtesting (forms to fill out, digital forms like Microsoft Forms, etc).
  
## Assignment deliverable
Today you will be doing a playtest of your final game. The results of which can be included as a formal playtest in your report.

## Playtest!
We're not super scaffolded today. You should be coordinating with the other students in your class to run playtests. This might take the form of a few different set-ups:
* If you are the only person from your team, you will likely set up a few computers and have playtesters come to you, recording the results. You should then go playtest their games.
* If there are a few of you from a team, then one of you should stay behind to run the playtest while others go and participate in other playtests. You can alternate later.

Ultimately, this time is what you make of it. At this stage your game should be in its later playtesting stages, and so we are trusting you to action the theory, tools and practices taught to you over this unit to make the most of this time. If you find yourself in a position with nothing to playtest, then you should focus on contributing to other students' playtests as a participant.

## Reflect
What have you learnt from today's playtest? While it'll take you writing up and analysing the data to make any changes, there might already be a few things that have popped out to you that you need to change for next time. Make sure you note these down for discussion with your group later.

## Next Week
Next week is the final prac! It will be focused on polishing your game, bug fixes and playtesting in a supported environment.
